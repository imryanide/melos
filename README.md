# Melos ðŸ’«
An emotional indicator to music

## How does it work ?
- The app identifies the song that is currently being played.
- Fetches a bunch of parameters (danceability, loudness, acousticness, tempo) related to the song.
- Based on the parameters, it calculates the emotion(s) that the listener's feeling.
- Using the emotion, it actuates specific IOT devices to change the ambience of the room.
